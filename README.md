My reasearch question was: How are sea ice coverage and CO2 emissions related. My goal was to make figures that show a trend of the two factors and how they've changed over the last 40 years. Using this, I wanted to relate the two together to show that they are inversely related. I found that the two have opposite directions and as the CO2 in the environment increases, the sea ice coverage goes down.
